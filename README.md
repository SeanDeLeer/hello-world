# hello-world
Hello to the world of GIT
Like everyone else that types Hello World ... just starting out on the journey to be a Data Scientist hopefully!

Day 1 of the Johns Hopkins Coursera course so looking forward to multiple similarly exciting updates :)

PS Any Red Bulls in Strasburg please feel free to say Hi. Will be off to there soon ... woo hoo!
